## Common(ish) Issues and Good Stuff
1. Database diagram is missing
2. Link to the working system is missing. 
3. Your descriptions do not clarify as much as I would like you to at this point regarding what you are implementing. 
4. Not being clear enough about the requirements a developer will need to implement. 
2. Some descriptions could be more clear. 
1. Please embed images in your wiki or markdown so we don't need to click for them. 
2. Your functional requirements would be better organized by the use cases, but I was able to follow what you are doing and its reasonably thorough. 
1. Good use case elaboration in the functional requirements
2. Server currently down.  
1. Good or Bad is likely too coarse of a photo evaluation measure.  Even if you provide a 0 to 1 range that will be more helpful. You could always create a cutoff for the range 0-0.6 == BAD && 0.61 >= GOOD, for example. 
2. Excellent description of your team's skills gaps
3. Nice ERD, summarizing only the tables you would use. 
4. Since its augur and you have a lot to work from, the absence of stubs is ok. 
5. Full points. 
1. Really specific details about where things will go in augur (Group 18)
2. Good stubs. 
3. Really solid ERD. Well thought out. 
4. Functional requirements are sufficient but not outstanding. You could provide more detail. 
1. Really beautiful design!
2. I assume the upload cap is related to your deployment environment. 
3. https://github.com/WestonV/RJI-Image-Classifier/wiki/Sprint-1 
4. Looking forward to seeing ranked images!
1. Love that you already have the system functional. 
2. I won't be grading on security, but you might think about wrapping the shell script in an API at some point because, though I have not tried, I'm pretty sure I could hack your server. Well, not me, but a white hat security hacker like Dr. Harrison would probably have access inside of 10 minutes. 
3. Well thought out connection between the use cases and your functional requirements, but please go ahead and use lists in the future. You don't have to change anything.
