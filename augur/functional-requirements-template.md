# Functional Requirements 

    + Functional Capabilities, features, or functions the software will execute
    + Finite test steps can be written for for a functional requirement. 
    + A description of a behavior that a system will exhibit under specific conditions. [Wiegers]

## Requirements are Refined

    - Business Requirements – WHY is the business starting this project? 
        - Vision and Scope
    - User Requirements – WHAT does the user need to do? 
        - Most often represented with Use Cases
    - Functional Requirements – WHAT does the developer implement? (Not HOW)
        - Derived from User Requirements, 
        - Influenced by System Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements
        - Gives the developer enough detail to know what to implement

## Example: User Requirements to Functional Requirements
    - User Requirement for a Web Browser:
        - The user shall be able to edit bookmarks.
    - Functional Requirements for a Web Browser:
        - The system shall display bookmarks as a collapsible and expandable hierarchical tree.
        - The user shall be able to resequence  bookmarks.
        - The system shall display bookmark properties.
        - The user shall be able to modify a bookmark’s name, URL, and description. [Wiegers]


## Translation of User Requirements to Functional Requirements to Software Spec

## Excellent Requirements Specs are [^Source: Video 24 - Characteristics of Excellent Requirements by Enfocus Solutions, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RSkUhZkPJM]: 
1. Complete – nothing missing (hard to tell!)
2. Consistent – does not conflict with other requirements
3. Correct – accurately states a user or external needs (customer is the judge)
4. Feasible – can be implemented within known constraints
5. Modifiable – can be changed, with history, when necessary (unique identifiers, changelog or source control history)
